        <h2>How she got her name</h2>
        <p>This is a very long story, but shorter than the rest. She is a new born calf and the owner of the cow
          `obviously` her mother, is a true worshiper of lord Krishna and he often goes to some spiritual place</p>

        <h2>How was she when born</h2>
        <p>A new life begins, with soft eyes and tiny steps, a symbol of hope and innocence.In the gentle warmth of its
          first breath, the world feels tender, touched by pure joy. With each breath, love blooms in endless space.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Her mother and else family reaction</h2>
        <p>Her eyes fill with love, a connection deeper than words, as she gazes at her calf for the first time. With a
          gentle nudge, she welcomes the fragile life, her heart swelling with pride and tenderness. In that sacred
          moment, the bond of mother and child is sealed, an unbreakable circle of protection and love.</p>
